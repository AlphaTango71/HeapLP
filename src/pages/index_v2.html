                            <p>Auto-tracking, retroactive analytics is a powerful concept, but without the right tools it, falls apart at scale. As the amount of data processed grows, many fast-growing companies find that Heap’s architecture simply can't
                                keep up.</p>
                            <p>Product leaders from leading companies have made the switch to Pendo to help them deliver software experiences users love. Pendo captures product usage patterns and user feedback to help you understand, onboard, educate and
                                guide users in-app.
